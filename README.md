_An (unfinished) hex multiplier I build._
### THIS MOD IS CURRENTLY ONLY INTENDED FOR NEW CREATIVE WORLDS
## Conductor
![conductor.png](pictures%2Fconductor.png)
Conducts redstone, signal level is decreased between adjecent conductors.

## Display
![display.png](pictures%2Fdisplay.png)
Displays signal strength it receives.

## Extender
![extender.png](pictures%2Fextender.png)
Any input signal results in maximum signal output.

## Relay
![relay.png](pictures%2Frelay.png)
Any input signal results in identical signal output.

Subtract side current (sum of signal received by the sides) from the input.

## Inverter
![inverter.png](pictures%2Finverter.png)
Any input signal results in inverted signal output.

Adds side current to the input before inverting it.



## Input
![input.png](pictures%2Finput.png)

Outputs a signal in range 0-15.

Clicking increases output signal strength by 1.

## Pulse
When clicked emits a 15 tick pulse.

When signal received emits a # tick pulse, with # being the signal strength.


## Toggle
When clicked toggles on and off.

On high signal change received toggles on and off.

### Advanced usages
![z relay advanced usage.png](pictures%2Fz%20relay%20advanced%20usage.png)
With the relay you can do subtraction.

![z inverter advanced usage.png](pictures%2Fz%20inverter%20advanced%20usage.png)
With the inverter you can do addition.

### Vanilla changes
Indirect power does not exist anymore. The new components work better with this change.
![zz indirect power.png](pictures%2Fzz%20indirect%20power.png)

Old components don't function : Button, Lever, Pressure Plate, Torch, Repeater, Dust.

Piston, Lamp, Noteblock, and Motion sensor still work. 

Dispensers, trapdoors, rails, and tnt will be made functional soon.
