# Better Than Redstone 
Redstone but 3-Dimensional!
### THIS MOD IS CURRENTLY ONLY INTENDED FOR NEW CREATIVE WORLDS
## Conductor
Conducts redstone, signal level is decreased between adjestent conductors.

## Extender
Any input signal results in maximum signal output.

## Relay
Any input signal results in identical signal output.

Subtract side current (sum of signal received by the sides) from the input.

## Inverter
Any input signal results in inverted signal output.

Adds side current to the input before inverting it.

## Display
Displays conductors signal strength.

## Input
Outputs a signal in range 0-15.

Clicking increases output signal strength by 1.

## Pulse
When clicked emits a 15 tick pulse.

When signal received emits a # tick pulse, with # being the signal strength.


## Toggle
When clicked toggles on and off.

On high signal change received toggles on and off.



### Vanilla changes
Indirect power does not exist anymore. The new components work better with this change.

Old components don't function : Button, Lever, Pressure Plate, Torch, Repeater, Dust.

Piston, Lamp, Noteblock, and Motion sensor still work. 

Dispensers, trapdoors, rails, and tnt will be made functional soon.
